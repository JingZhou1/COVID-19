# COVID-19
The research objective is to examine how the pandemic behave across different communities.

## 1. Collect data
Pick four counties which can be split into two groups;
Split them based on population characteristics (social economic indexes like consumer price index, unemployee rate and income level, race, ethnicity mix, etc). The four counties are 
- Los Angeles County(CA) 
- Maricopa(AZ)
- Queens(NY)
- Lycoming County(PA)

## 2. Feed the data into model
Fit Gompertz functions to these four counties to identify best predicting parameters (a, b, c) using R language. 

## 3. Run regression 
Identify supply chain related factors (major shipping hub, availability of health care facilities, number of healthcare worker, medical supply, inventory control, etc) and run regressions to see what supply chain factors are most influential to the spread of the pandemic.

## 4. Analysis and interpret the results
Analysis the outcome, explore any chances for improvement, and visualize the findings.
