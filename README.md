## 1. Collect data
Pick four communities which can be split into two groups;
Split them based on population characteristics (social economic indexes like consumer price index, unemployee rate and income level, race, ethnicity mix, etc).

## 2. Feed the data into model
Fit Gompertz functions to these four communities to identify best predicting parameters (a, b, c).

## 3. Run regression 
Identify supply chain related factors (major shipping hub, availability of health care facilities, number of healthcare worker, medical supply, inventory control, etc) and run regressions to see what supply chain factors are most influential to the spread of the pandemic.

## 4. Analysis and interpret the results
