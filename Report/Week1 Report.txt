Hi professor Wang,

I hope you are doing well. I'm writing this email to report my research progress in the past week. 

What I have done this weekÂ 
I have picked four counties which I'm interested in as my research objects, two in the east part and two in the western part of the US. 

I have made a preliminary plan on how to conduct my research based on professor Wang's suggestions. I have selected R language to implement Gompertz functions after studying a tumor growth example. 

I focused on step 1 which is collecting relevant data at county-level and state level. For the COVID-19, I have collected cumulative time-series data of positive cases. For the four counties, I have collected data from consumer price index, unemployment rate, income level to population density, and median age. For the supply chain factor, I have collected data related to the availability of health care facilities, healthcare workers.

What I'm going to work on in the coming week
I'm going to fit Gompertz functions to these four counties to identify best predicting parameters (a, b, c) using R language. After this, I would move to step 3. 

What questions I have encountered
As data validity is critical in research, I spent plenty of time on collecting reliable data. But I found that it is not easy to collect data on lower level. For example, I have found data about healthcare workers' availability in the Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area, but I didn't find the data at the county-level. I started from the government website like https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcma.htm and then move to some open databases like UCI Machine Learning Database. I would keep exploring any other data resources available.


Thanks for your time on reading my report. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thank you. 


Best,
Jing
