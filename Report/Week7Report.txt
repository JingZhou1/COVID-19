Hi professor Wang,

I hope you are doing well. I'm writing this email to report my research progress in the past week.

What I have done this week 
1. I explored various scenarios of checking and eliminating heteroscedasticity. The model with a log transformation on the DV is selected as a base case.

The regression results show that population density, the number of healthcare workers, and the mileage of freight railroads are significant. 

2. I searched around but didn't find data about the availability of masks, respirators, and ventilators. But I found the number of Hospital Beds per 1,000 Population at the state level. I included this new data into my regression and the results for the base model didn't change. 

3. I run the longitudinal data analysis in Rstudio. The results (see below) suggest that the number of major airports and healthcare workers' hourly mean wage are significant, which are quite different from the base model. 
  

What I'm going to work on in the coming week
I'm going to keep investigating why these two models give different results and which one performs better in this scenario. 

What questions I have encountered
I really appreciate this valuable opportunity to learn and I would love to keep working on this research project. But I have some incoming job interviews and tech assessments to prepare. I'm wondering if it is possible for me to report my research progress every two weeks? 

Thank you for taking the time to read my report. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks. 


Best,
Jing
