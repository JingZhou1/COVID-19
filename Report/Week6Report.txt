Hi professor Wang,

I hope you are doing well. I'm writing this email to report my research progress in the past week.

What I have done this week 
1. I standardized my data and run the regression again. The results looks similar to the original model.  

As the residuals plots suggest heteroskedasticity, I use robust method to deal with it. The R-square and Adjusted R-square in the new model has been largely improved and the results have changed. The number of healthcare workers is now significant, and the number of major airports is no longer significant compared to the original model. 

Concerned with heteroskedasticity issue, I run Breusch-Pagan test to check for heteroskedasticity and the results suggests no heteroskedasticity issue.

2. I explored longitudinal regression analysis and I feel it is kind of more complicated than the models I encountered before. As my data comprising repeated measurements of the same individuals over time, it  seems to fit my question. But the number of infections is the only variable keeps changing over time and all the other variables remain constant. This is different from the examples I saw by googling around. I would spend more time to explore about this method. 

3. I put together my research findings and interpretations into a Word document. Please find the file attached below.  
 
What I'm going to work on in the coming week
I'm going to keep learning about longitudinal regression analysis and try to implement this approach. 

What questions I have encountered
The residuals plot suggests heteroskedasticity presents while the Breusch-Pagan test gives the opposite results. What do you think?

Thank you for taking the time to read my report. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks. 


Best,
Jing
