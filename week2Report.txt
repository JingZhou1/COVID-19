What I have done this week 
1. I preprocessed the data I collected in the first week and turned them into structured datasets. 

2. I fit Gompertz functions to the counties of interest and tried to identify best predicting parameters in Rstudio but encountered some unknown issues. 

3. I switched to Spicy and built the model in python. I used the model to predict the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. For example, the number of positive cases in Maricopa is expected to increase to 3571 by June 1st. 

What I'm going to work on in the coming week
I'm going to run regressions with supply chain related factors including availability of health care facilities and healthcare workers to see if they are influential to the spread of the pandemic.

What questions I have encountered
When I fit the Gompertz functions in Rstudio, it says "
Error in numericDeriv(form[[3L]], names(ind), env) :
  Missing value or an infinity produced when evaluating the model "
I tried to plug in other datasets, it works well but doesn't work with the COVID-19 data. I would spend more this week to see if I can fix the bug.
